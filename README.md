# KiesFictief

Simple funny fictional political quiz game where one could see which party they align the most with. Front-end done in Vue.js 3, back-end runs on Express.js.

### TODO:
* Refactor code
* ~~Same as above, but more specific: Make `service/controllers/QuizController.js` a lot smaller, it's currently too big of a mess. Needs to be split up into multiple files, i.e. by moving helper functions to a global file~~

## Project Setup (front-end & back-end)

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
